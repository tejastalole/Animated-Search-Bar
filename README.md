## 💻 How It Works

1. Click on the **magnifier icon**:
   - Expands the container to show the search bar and microphone.
   - Applies neumorphic shadows for depth effect.
2. Click again on the **magnifier**:
   - Animates the collapse and hides the elements smoothly.
3. JavaScript handles toggling by **adding/removing CSS classes** to animate width, opacity, and visibility.
